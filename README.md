# PIG

This is a web application to play the game of Pig. The goal is to reach the assigned final score by rolling dice.

Players can keep rolling to build their current score and hit HOLD to add the points to their overall score.

However, if any player rolls a 1 or rolls the same number twice in a row, the player loses the current points and
loses their turn to roll. 

Players can decide what the winning score should be and enter it in the Final Score field
at the bottom of the application.
